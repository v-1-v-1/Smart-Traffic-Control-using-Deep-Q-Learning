# Smart-Traffic-Control-using-Deep-Q-Learning

Addressing global traffic congestion through an adaptive and intelligent approach, smart traffic control leverages reinforcement learning for dynamic signal optimization.

## Method
- Pre-Programmed Signal Timings: Traditional systems use fixed signal timings based on historical data.
- Real-Time Adaptation: Lack of adaptability to real-time conditions leads to traffic inefficiencies.
- Deep Q-Learning Framework: Utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for traffic signal control policy learning.
- Q-Value Estimation: Estimates Q-values to determine the optimal traffic signal timings.
- Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Action selection incorporates epsilon-greedy policy for exploration-exploitation balance.
- Bellman Equation: Reinforcement learning leverages the Bellman equation for iterative Q-value updates.
